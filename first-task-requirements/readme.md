# Your First Task as a Web Developer

## Description

You are given a mockup of the web page that you need to create. Try to replicate it with as much fidelity as you can.

## Motivation

Determining the knowledge level of all students, so we can tailor the training programme according to your needs, focusing on the areas that you don't quite master yet. Your assignments will be thoroughly analyzed and you will receive feeback on your work, hoping that you will apply the feedack during the entire training programme.

## Handy skills

2. HTML5 forms
3. CSS and CSS layouts (_flex_, _grid_, _float_)
4. Basic JavaScript

9. For _At a glance_ section, use the provided URLs for HTML5 & CSS3 logos and the local file (`assets/javascript.png`) for JavaScript logo.

## Recommendations

1. If you do not know how to replicate a certain element, just skip it.
2. Use HTML5 semantic elements (i.e. `<header>` or `<section>` instead of `<div>`)
3. You may consult any documentations, websites, forums or other sources for inspiration, but **please do not use ChatGPT or other generative AI models**
4. Do not use any other libraries or external resources, except for the ones mentioned above (Google Fonts and IonIcons)
5. Approach as many tasks as you can for today's session. Finish the website until next time.
6. Contact me on my e-mail (bogdan@chesscoders.com) for any questions you may have or any help you may need.
7. Start with HTML structure, then add the CSS, then the JS
8. Leave the task of responsiveness (mobile design) for the final part of your assignment
